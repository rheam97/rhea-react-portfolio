      </h1>

      <div className="text-center bio">
        <p>
        I'm a soon-to-be full stack developer with a previous
                    interdisciplinary background in International Relations, Anthropology, Social and Public Policy, and
                    applications of Social Psychology
                    and Neuroscience to policymaking. Learning new things constantly has been and continues to be my
                    bread-and-butter, which is why I feel suited to the field of software development. I am proficient in RESTful APIs, vanilla JS, and advanced CSS frameworks and am currently
                    learning building MERN apps and honing my CS fundamentals. 
          <br />
          <br /> I look forward to hearing from you
          regarding joining your team as a driven, personable, and adaptable member.
